## Installing Skyrim Together Reborn and Mods

To begin, you must have a clean install of Syrim Special edition on Steam

When Skyrim is finished installing, launch the application through steam. In the Launcher, make sure *Windowed* and *Borderless* are selected. Graphic settings are to your personal preference. Boot up Skyrim to the title screen and then exit.

Go to the folder in which you have Skyrim Special Edition installed, then navigate to: \steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data

Delete the following files, these are located at the very top of the file list:

ccBGSSSE001-Fish.bsa

ccBGSSSE001-Fish.esm 

ccBGSSSE025-AdvDSGS.bsa

ccBGSSSE025-AdvDSGS.esm 

ccBGSSSE037-Curios.bsa 

ccBGSSSE037-Curios.esl 

ccQDRSSE001-SurvivalMode.bsa 

ccQDRSSE001-SurvivalMode.esl


Make sure you have [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) installed. You will need to make a Nexus account to be able to install the mods to Skyrim [it can be done without, but for the sake of ease, we will be using Vortex].

Once Vortex is installed, go to the dashboard located in the left panel.

From here you will go to *Profile Management* underneath "Let's get you set up". Click it so it says "Yes" below.

From here, go to *Games* in the same left panel. Here you will look for Skyrim Special Edition. Click "Manage" on it and it will open. Then go to Mods in Vortex. Close any pop-ups by hitting cancel [these may not happen, so don't worry if they don't].

Save the zip folders contained in the mod folder here to you computer. They must all be individual zip folders for each mod, like this:

Navigate to *Mods* in the left panel. At the bottom is should say "Drop Files"

Drag and drop all your zip files here, they should all be automatically installed.
